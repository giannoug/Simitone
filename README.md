NOTE! Currently does not support the entire Fame career track, saving on vacation and a few other important things. While all objects run, many of them have bugs that can make certain lot types unplayable. For current development progress, see [this issue.](https://github.com/riperiperi/Simitone/issues/8)

*Only for Desktop Windows.* Other platforms cannot be officially supported.

# Everyday gameplay development branch

Current batch: [results and remaining tests](docs/testing/vacation-work-results.md), [Windows test guide](docs/testing/windows-test-guide.md), and [Windows build artifacts](https://github.com/giannoug/Simitone/actions).

This branch adds guarded saves, household stale-state checks, draft-based audio/display options and ordinary community-destination selection. The package-free checks pass on Linux; Windows gameplay and original-game compatibility remain unverified. Full eviction cleanup and robust home-snapshot restore work are still pending. See [implementation results and remaining work](docs/testing/release-1-results.md) and the [manual test matrix](docs/testing/everyday-gameplay-matrix.md).

# Purpose

On modern operating systems, The Sims has a few nagging issues that make it less than playable. Simitone can be seen as a tool to improve the playability of your existing installation of The Sims. Here are some features:

- Playable in 3D - using a combination of models generated from the 2D sprites and created by the community.
  - [Download the mesh pack here!](http://forum.freeso.org/forums/3d-remeshing.40/)
- Custom user interface that works at modern resolutions. Working on a more desktop oriented interface.
- Improved graphical performance, support for high resolutions and refresh rates.
- Custom lighting - directional lights with smooth falloffs and shadows using generated 3D meshes.
- *Volcanic*, a program which allows you to examine, modify and create new game objects. (from FreeSO)

# Why is it called Simitone?

Simitone -> Semitone -> musical term -> C# -> a note
